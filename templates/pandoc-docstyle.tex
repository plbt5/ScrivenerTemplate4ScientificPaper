%%% About this LaTeX template: %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This template should work with any (reasonably recent) full
% installation of TeXLive or MikTeX. The "ecis2015" package loads a
% number of other packages, so if some package is missing, please
% install it using the package manager of your TeX distribution. In
% particular, if the "tikz" package is missing, you may have to install
% "pgf" or simply remove our example graphics (see figure example
% below).
%
% The file "ecis2015.sty" should be placed somewhere in your TeX Path
% (or simply in the same folder as your document).
%
% Please use PDFLaTeX to compile your document.
%
% You need not escape special characters or Umlauts like é ä ö ü ß (in 
% fact, you shouldn't), as this source is inputenc'd in UTF-8.
%
% Note for BibTeX users: We use BibLaTeX for formatting, so we use Biber
% as a sorting backend (default). 
% If you still need to use the old BibTeX program, please change the 
% BibLaTeX backend in the package file ("ecis2015.sty").

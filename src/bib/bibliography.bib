abstract = {Within cognitive science, two approaches currently dominate the problem of modeling representations. The symbolic approach views cognition as computation involving symbolic manipulation. Connectionism, a special case of associationism, models associations using artificial neuron networks. Peter Gardenfors offers his theory of conceptual representations as a bridge between the symbolic and connectionist approaches. Symbolic representation is particularly weak at modeling concept learning, which is paramount for understanding many cognitive phenomena. Concept learning is closely tied to the notion of similarity, which is also poorly served by the symbolic approach. Gardenfors's theory of conceptual spaces presents a framework for representing information on the conceptual level. A conceptual space is built up from geometrical structures based on a number of quality dimensions. The main applications of the theory are on the constructive side of cognitive science: as a constructive model the theory can be applied to the development of artificial systems capable of solving cognitive tasks. Gardenfors also shows how conceptual spaces can serve as an explanatory framework for a number of empirical theories, in particular those concerning concept formation, induction, and semantics. His aim is to present a coherent research program that can be used as a basis for more detailed investigations.},

abstract = {In the work presented in this thesis, we systematically study some of the relations between a modeling language and a set of real-world phenomena in a given domain. Thus, one of the questions which are addressed here is: how can we assess the ontology adequacy of a given modeling language? In simple terms, ontological adequacy is a measure of how close the models produced using a modeling language are to the situations in reality they are supposed to represent. In this thesis, we show how modeling languages can be evaluated and (re)designed with the purpose of improving their ontological adequacy, by proposing a systematic evaluation method for comparing a metamodel of the concepts underlying a language to a reference ontology of the corresponding domain in reality.},

abstract = {Poor data quality can seriously hinder or damage the efficiency and effectiveness of organizations and businesses. The growing awareness of such repercussions has led to major public initiatives like the "Data Quality Act" in the USA and the "European 2003/98" directive of the European Parliament. Batini and Scannapieco present a comprehensive and systematic introduction to the wide set of issues related to data quality. They start with a detailed description of different data quality dimensions, like accuracy, completeness, and consistency, and their importance in different types of data, like federated data, web data, or time-dependent data, and in different data categories classified according to frequency of change, like stable, long-term, and frequently changing data. The book's extensive description of techniques and methodologies from core data quality research as well as from related fields like data mining, probability theory, statistical data analysis, and machine learning gives an excellent overview of the current state of the art. The presentation is completed by a short description and critical comparison of tools and practical methodologies, which will help readers to resolve their own quality problems. This book is an ideal combination of the soundness of theoretical foundations and the applicability of practical approaches. It is ideally suited for everyone -- researchers, students, or professionals -- interested in a comprehensive overview of data quality issues. In addition, it will serve as the basis for an introductory course or for self-study on this topic. This is a comprehensive description of the Enterprise Ontology, a collection of terms and definitions relevant to business enterprises. We state its intended purposes, describe how we went about building it, define all the terms and describe our experiences in converting these into formal definitions. We then describe how we used the Enterprise Ontology and give an evaluation which compares the actual uses with original purposes. We conclude by summarising what we have learned. The Enterprise Ontology was developed within the Enterprise Project, a collaborative effort to provide a framework for enterprise modelling. The ontology was built to serve as a basis for this framework which includes methods and a computer tool set for enterprise modelling. We give an overview of the Enterprise Project, elaborate on the intended use of the ontology, and give a brief overview of the process we went through to build it. The scope of the Enterprise Ontology covers those core concepts required for the project, which will appeal to a wider audience. We present natural language definitions for all the terms, starting with the foundational concepts (e.g. entity, relationship, actor). These are used to define the main body of terms, which are divided into the following subject areas: activities, organisation, strategy and marketing. We review some of the things learned during the formalisation process of converting the natural language definitions into Ontolingua. We identify and propose solutions for what may be general problems occurring in the development of a wide range of ontologies in other domains. We then characterise in general terms the sorts of issues that will be faced when converting an informal ontology into a formal one. Finally, we describe our experiences in using the Enterprise Ontology. We compare these with the intended uses, noting our successes and failures. We conclude with an overall evaluation and summary of what we have learned.},

abstract = {Context The association of an adult tele-intensive care unit (ICU) intervention with hospital mortality, length of stay, best practice adherence, and preventable complications for an academic medical center has not been reported. Objective To quantify the association of a tele-ICU intervention with hospital mortality, length of stay, and complications that are preventable by adherence to best practices. Design, Setting, and Patients Prospective stepped-wedge clinical practice study of 6290 adults admitted to any of 7 ICUs (3 medical, 3 surgical, and 1 mixed cardiovascular) on 2 campuses of an 834-bed academic medical center that was performed from April 26, 2005, through September 30, 2007. Electronically supported and monitored processes for best practice adherence, care plan creation, and clinician response times to alarms were evaluated. Main Outcome Measures Case-mix and severity-adjusted hospital mortality. Other outcomes included hospital and ICU length of stay, best practice adherence, and complication rates. Results The hospital mortality rate was 13.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.9%-15.4%) during the preintervention period compared with 11.8% (95% CI, 10.9%-12.8%) during the tele-ICU intervention period (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.40 [95% CI, 0.31-0.52]). The tele-ICU intervention period compared with the preintervention period was associated with higher rates of best clinical practice adherence for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (99% vs 85%, respectively; OR, 15.4 [95% CI, 11.3-21.1]) and prevention of stress ulcers (96% vs 83%, respectively; OR, 4.57 [95% CI, 3.91-5.77], best practice adherence for cardiovascular protection (99% vs 80%, respectively; OR, 30.7 [95% CI, 19.3-49.2]), prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (52% vs 33%, respectively; OR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.79-2.70]), lower rates of preventable complications (1.6% vs 13%, respectively, for ventilator-associated pneumonia [OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.23] and 0.6% vs 1.0%, respectively, for catheter-related bloodstream infection [OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.27-0.93]), and shorter hospital length of stay (9.8 vs 13.3 days, respectively; hazard ratio for discharge, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.33-1.56]). The results for medical, surgical, and cardiovascular ICUs were similar. Conclusion In a single academic medical center study, implementation of a tele-ICU intervention was associated with reduced adjusted odds of mortality and reduced hospital length of stay, as well as with changes in best practice adherence and lower rates of preventable complications.

In contrast, we argue that space and time are fundamental ordering relations for knowledge organization, representation, and reasoning. While most research on Semantic Web reasoning has focused on thematic aspects, this paper argues for a unified view combining a spatial, temporal, and thematic component. Besides their impact on the representation of and reasoning about individuals and classes, we outline the role of space and time for ontology modularization, evolution, and the handling of vague and contradictory knowledge. Instead of proposing yet another specific methodology, the presented work illustrates the relevance of space and time using various examples from the geo-sciences.},

Several ontologies already exist to express measurements, W3C's SSN ontology being a prominent example.

Moreover, a measure of an observation in itself is almost always inconclusive without the context in which the measure was obtained.

abstract = {* Earlier versions of this paper have been presented at the 1997 AAAI Spring Symposium and the1998 Banff Knowledge Acquisition Workshop. The current version has been substantially expanded. Much of the work on ontologies in AI has focused on describing some aspect of reality: objects, relations, states of affairs, events, and processes in the world. A goal is to make knowledge sharable, by encoding domain knowledge using a standard vocabulary based on the ontology. A parallel attempt at identifying the ontology of problem-solving knowledge has a goal of sharable problem-solving methods. For example, when one is dealing with abductive inference problems, the following are some of the terms that occur in the representation of problem-solving methods: hypotheses, explanatory coverage, evidence, likelihood, plausibility, composite hypothesis, etc. Method ontology is, in good part, goal- and method-specific. ``Generic Tasks,'' ``Heuristic Classification,'' ``Task-specific Architectures,'' ``Task-method Structures,'' ``Inference Structures'' and ``Task Structures'' are representative bodies of work in the knowledge-systems area that have focused on domain-independent problem-solving methods. However, connections have not been made to work that is explicitly concerned with domain ontologies. Making such connections is the goal of this paper. This paper is part review and part synthesis.},

It follows different approaches for defining information before discussing a knowledge-in-action view on information as part of sociomaterial practices. Drawing from Stamper's (1991) extended semiological framework the paper proposes its reinterpretation to study information as a sociomaterial phenomenon. The paper further argues that rather than focusing on finding general definitions for information, intellectual efforts should concentrate on characteristics and attributes of information. Combining earlier efforts in this direction different attributes of information such as novelty, time dependence, or goal relevance. are introduced. Locating those attributes within Stamper's extended semiological framework helps to identify different aspects of sociomaterial context affecting information. Understanding and paying attention to information through its attributes can, therefore, provide guidance for researching information and possibly help advancing the development of information systems.

abstract = {Most information systems today are built using ``single-level'' methodologies, in which both informational and knowledge concepts are built into one level of object and data models. In domains characterised by complexity, large numbers of concepts, and/or a high rate of definitional change, systems based on such models are expensive to maintain and usually have to be replaced after a few years. However, a two-level methodology is possible, in which systems are built from information models only, and driven at runtime by knowledge-level concept definitions, or ``archetypes''. In this approach, systems can be built more quickly and last longer, whilst archetypes are authored directly by domain specialists, rather than IT personnel. Executed properly, the approach has the potential for creating future-proof systems and information. Work in the medical informatics domain on electronic health records (EHRs) has shown that a two-level methodology is implementable, makes for smaller systems, and empowers domain users.

Accordingly, a successful telemedicine program will follow the basic tenets of quality improvement: performing a detailed needs assessment, assessing the barriers to practice change, prioritizing specific projects, introducing effective strategies for improvement, and measuring the results in a stepwise fashion. Similar to traditional quality improvement, an approach in which this technology is introduced without setting specific quality goals and defining clear quality improvement processes is likely to fail. Instead, it is important to define specific quality deficiencies in the target ICUs, and then design the telemedicine intervention specifically to address those deficiencies, akin to other types of quality improvement."

However, current mainstream research on this topic faces serious challenges, which forces us to question established lines of research and to rethink the underlying approaches. We argue that reasoning for the Semantic Web should be understood as ``shared inference,'' which is not necessarily based on deductive methods. Model-theoretic semantics (and sound and complete reasoning based on it) functions as a gold standard, but applications dealing with large-scale and noisy data usually cannot afford the required runtimes. Approximate methods, including deductive ones, but also approaches based on entirely different methods like machine learning or nature-inspired computing need to be investigated, while quality assurance needs to be done in terms of precision and recall values (as in information retrieval) and not necessarily in terms of soundness and completeness of the underlying algorithms.},

While all of them address different visions and needs, they share a common theme: How do we manage massive amounts of heterogeneous data, derive knowledge out of them instead of drowning in information, and how do we make our findings reproducible and reusable by others? In a network of knowledge, topics span across scientific disciplines and the idea of domain ontologies as common agreements seems like an illusion. In this work, we argue that these trends require a radical paradigm shift in ontology engineering away from a small number of authoritative, global ontologies developed top-down, to a high number of local ontologies that are driven by application needs and developed bottom-up out of observation data. Similarly as the early Web was replaced by a social Web in which volunteers produce data instead of purely consuming it, the next generation of knowledge infrastructures has to enable users to become knowledge engineers themselves. Surprisingly, existing ontology engineering frameworks are not well suited for this new perspective. Hence, we propose an observation-driven ontology engineering framework, show how its layers can be realized using specific methodologies, and relate the framework to existing work on geo-ontologies.},

abstract = {In philosophy, the term ontology has been used since the 17th century to refer both to a philosophical discipline (Ontology with a capital ``O''), and as a domain-independent system of categories that can be used in the conceptualization of domain-specific scientific theories. In the past decades there has been a growing interest in the subject of ontology in computer and information sciences. In the last few years, this interest has expanded considerably in the context of the Semantic Web and MDA (Model-Driven Architecture) research efforts, and due to the role ontologies are perceived to play in these initiatives. In this paper, we explore the relations between Ontology and ontologies in the philosophical sense with domain ontologies in computer science. Moreover, we elaborate on formal characterizations for the notions of ontology, conceptualization and metamodel, as well as on the relations between these notions. Additionally, we discuss a set of criteria that a modeling language should meet in order to be considered a suitable language to model phenomena in a given domain, and present a systematic framework for language evaluation and design. Furthermore, we argue for the importance of ontology in both philosophical senses aforementioned for designing and evaluating a suitable general ontology representation language, and we address the question whether the so-called Ontology Web languages can be considered as suitable general ontology representation languages. Finally, we motivate the need for two complementary classes of modeling languages in Ontology Engineering addressing two separate sets of concerns.},

abstract = {What is needed to enable communication about observation and measurement results in information systems? Information system ontologies make a certain conceptualization explicit and partially account for the meanings of symbols associated with this conceptualization. Yet, the meaning of signs denoting measurement results such as ``10 m'', ``red'' or ``high'' cannot be specified with currently available ontologies. They fail to separate the ontological nature of some observable quality from the specification of how to observe and name the measurement result. We employ the foundational ontology DOLCE for characterizing the ontological nature of observable magnitudes. This involves dealing with ontological questions like ``What kinds of observable qualities exist, in which entity does the observed quality inhere and how are the magnitudes of the observed quality structured?''. Then, in order to capture the semantic aspects of an observation result, we introduce semantic reference spaces, which help deal with semantic questions like ``Do the signs ``10 m'', ``33 feet'' or ``shallow'' have the same meaning? Do these signs refer to the same entity, e.g. the depth magnitude of a lake? How to establish a unit of measure?''. We posit that the semantic questions can be approached efficiently only if agreement is reached on the ontological questions, and show that the specification of the meaning of signs denoting measurement results is enabled via the extension of the foundational ontology DOLCE with semantic reference spaces.},

abstract = {Patient observations in health care, subjective surveys in social research  or dyke sensor data in water management are all examples of measurements.  Several ontologies already exist to express measurements, W3C's SSN ontology  being the most prominent of them. However, these ontologies address quantities  and properties as being equal, and ignore the foundation required to establish  comparability between sensor data. Moreover, a measure of an observation in itself  is almost always inconclusive without the context in which the measure was  obtained. ContoExam addresses these aspects, providing for a unifying capability  for context-aware expressions of observations about quantities and properties alike,  by aligning them to ontological foundations, and by binding observations  inextricably with their context.},

abstract = {Much effort has been spent on the optimization of sensor networks, mainly concerning their performance and power efficiency. Furthermore, open communication protocols for the exchange of sensor data have been developed and widely adopted, making sensor data widely available for software applications. However, less attention has been given to the interoperability of sensor networks and sensor network applications at a semantic level. This hinders the reuse of sensor networks in different applications and the evolution of existing sensor networks and their applications. The main contribution of this paper is an ontology-based approach and architecture to address this problem. We developed an ontology that covers concepts regarding examinations as well as measurements, including the circumstances in which the examination and measurement have been performed. The underlying architecture secures a loose coupling at the semantic level to facilitate reuse and evolution. The ontology has the potential of supporting not only correct interpretation of sensor data, but also ensuring its appropriate use in accordance with the purpose of a given sensor network application. The ontology has been specialized and applied in a remote patient monitoring example, demonstrating the aforementioned potential in the e-health domain.},

abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse --- definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects --- is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.},

abstract = {As an alternative modeling infrastructure and paradigm, multi-level modeling addresses many of the conceptual weaknesses found in the four level modeling infrastructure that underpins traditional modeling approaches like UML and EMF. It does this by explicitly distinguishing between linguistic and ontological forms of classification and by allowing the influence of classifiers to extend over more than one level of instantiation. Multi-level modeling is consequently starting to receive attention from a growing number of research groups. However, there has never been a concrete definition of a language designed from the ground-up for the specific purpose of representing multi-level models. Some authors have informally defined the ``look and feel'' of such a language, but to date there has been no systematic or fully elaborated definition of its concrete syntax. In this paper we address this problem by introducing the key elements of a language, known as the Level-Agnostic Modeling Language (LML) designed to support multi-level modeling.},

While a solution is not reached, it is widely recognized that the need to integrate information is so pressing that it does not matter if detail is lost, as long as integration is achieved. This paper shows the potential for information retrieval at different levels of granularity inside the framework of information systems based on ontologies. Ontologies are theories that use a specific vocabulary to describe entities, classes, properties and functions related to a certain view of the world. The use of an ontology, translated into an active information system component, leads to ontology-driven information systems and, in the specific case of GIS, leads to what we call ontology-driven geographic information systems.},

They provide means to integrate developers with the software process and the supporting technology. Since during software development many information resources are produced and used, it is very important to add semantics to them in order to improve the assistance given by the environment. In this context, ontologies are a key enabling technology for Semantic SEEs (SSEEs). A SSEE can be viewed as a SEE in which part of the information handled has associated a formal meaning (semantics), augmenting its tools' ability to work in conjunction with each other and with human developers. This paper discusses how ontologies are used in ODE, an Ontology-based software Development Environment, to make it a SSEE.},

abstract = {An organization depends on quality information for effective operations and decision-making. However, fundamental questions still remain as to how quality should be defined and the specific criteria that should be used to evaluate information quality. Previous work adopted either an intuitive, empirical, or theoretical approach to address this problem; however, we believe that an integrated research approach is required to ensure both rigour and scope. This paper presents an information quality framework based on semiotic theory, the linguistic theory of sign-based communication, to describe the form-, meaning-, and use-related aspects of information. This provides a sound theoretical basis both for defining quality categories, previously defined in an ad-hoc manner, based on these different information aspects and for integrating the different research approaches required to derive quality criteria for each category. The goal of our work is to provide an approach to defining information quality that is both theoretically grounded and practical that can serve as a basis for further research in data quality assessment and decision support.},

A major issue is the inability of Search Engine technology to wade through the vast expanse of questionable content and return "quality" results to a user's query. This paper attempts to address some of the issues involved in determining what quality is, as it pertains to information retrieval on the Internet. The IQIP model is presented as an approach to managing the choice and implementation of quality related algorithms of an Internet crawling Search Engine.},

abstract = {The task of information extraction can be seen as a problem of semantic matching between a user-defined template and a piece of information written in natural language. To this purpose, the ontological assumptions of the template need to be suitably specified, and compared with the ontological implications of the text. So-called ``ontologies'', consisting of theories of various kinds expressing the meaning of shared vocabularies, begin to be used for this task. This paper addresses the theoretical issues related to the design and use of such ontologies for purposes of information retrieval and extraction. After a discussion on the nature of semantic matching within a model-theoretical framework, we introduce the subject of Formal Ontology, showing how the notions of parthood, integrity, identity, and dependence can be of help in understanding, organizing and formalizing fundamental ontological distinctions. We present then some basic principles for ontology design, and we illustrate a preliminary proposal for a top-level ontology developed according to such principles. As a concrete example of ontology-based information retrieval, we finally report an ongoing experience of use of a large linguistic ontology for the retrieval of object-oriented software components.},

abstract = {Goals are often used to represent stakeholder's objectives. The intentionality inherited by a goal drives stakeholders to pursuit the fulfillment of their goals either by themselves or by delegating this fulfillment to third parties. In Service-Oriented Computing, service client's requirements are commonly expressed in terms of inputs, outputs, pre-conditions and effects, also known as IOPE. End-users, i.e., human service clients, may have difficulties to express such requirements as they would have to deal with technical issues such as the request's language, and the type, format and coding of the IOPE. This paper presents the core concepts of the Goal-Based Service Ontology (GSO) that relates goals and services. By grounding GSO in a well-founded ontology we aim at clarifying the semantics for a set of relevant domain concepts that can support specialists in defining application ontologies based on goals and services.},
